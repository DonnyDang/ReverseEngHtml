        <p><b>1. Outrage over the death of George Floyd</b> has incited a wave of demonstrations and unrest across the country.</p>
        <p>From the streets of Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd went limp after a police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes, to outside the White House gates and more than two dozen besieged cities like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/nyregion/protests-nyc-george-floyd.html?&te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">New York</a>, above, protesters re-energized the street uprisings that gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement six years ago. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/minneapolis-floyd-protests.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage&te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">Here’s the latest</a>.</p>
        <p>Rallies and looting bordered on civil meltdown, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/30/us/police-protest-photos.html?te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">scenes of peaceful protest and violence</a> played out against the dystopian backdrop of a pandemic that has kept much of the nation at home for months. Curfews were imposed in some of America’s largest cities.</p>
        <p>Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota activated thousands of National Guard troops — up to 13,200 — to control protesters in Minneapolis who turned out in droves for the fifth night in a row. He declined the Army’s offer of military police.</p>
        <p>Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who pinned Mr. Floyd, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Here’s what happened in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-worked-together.html?te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">the chaotic moments before Mr. Floyd’s death</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/george-floyd-minneapolis-death.html?te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">more on Mr. Floyd</a>.</p>

        <p><b>3. Twitter had been drawing</b> a line for months when President Trump crossed it.</p>
        <p>The final straw came when Mr. Trump implied that protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. A group of more than 10 Twitter officials quickly gathered virtually to review Mr. Trump’s post and ultimately decided to hide it with a warning label that said the message violated its policy against glorifying violence.</p>
        <p>The decision was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/technology/twitter-trump-dorsey.html?&te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">the culmination of months of debate inside Twitter</a>. For more than a year, the company had been developing a protocol to limit the impact of objectionable messages from world leaders — and what to do when Mr. Trump inevitably broke it.</p>

        <p>New York City is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-reopening-dates.html?te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">on track to start reopening on June 8</a> after being under one of the country’s strictest lockdowns. Under the first phase of reopening, nonessential stores could open for curbside pickup, and nonessential construction and manufacturing could resume.</p>
        <p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo said state officials were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-live-updates.html?&te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">focusing on controlling hot spots in the city</a> and preparing its hospitals to deal with a potential second spike. Above, people line up outside a food pantry in Jackson Heights, Queens.</p>
        <p>That mirrors global developments, as the virus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html?te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">caseload surpassed six million</a>.

        <p>The Chinese government tightened its grip over Hong Kong this week, enacting sweeping national security laws that democracy advocates fear will target dissent. The protest movement found that the tactics it had used to push officials in Beijing to retreat at times last summer were suddenly inadequate.</p>
        <p>Protesters now face an aggressive police force, fear of the coronavirus and a Chinese Communist Party that has run out of patience. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-future-china.html?&te=1&nl=the-morning&emc=edit_nn_20200531" target="_blank">Many protesters, some of whom are pictured above this week, feel they have exhausted their options</a>.</p>

        <p>The N.B.A. wants to start up again in late July; the N.H.L. announced a playoff tournament through the summer; Major League Baseball is hoping to hammer out a deal with players by Monday for a shortened season; the N.F.L. is moving toward opening training facilities.
